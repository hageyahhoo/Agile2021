# Title
Technical Agile Coaches' Unit:
One Way of Freeing Technical and Psychological Barriers from Your Product Development
⭐️ アジャイルコーチと、技術チームの双方の不安解消策の方が良いやも
- Technical | Experience Report



# Abstract
⭐️ Pain pointを刺激する
⭐️ 技術的なアプローチの方法が分からなくて困っていませんか？ ⭐️

技術は怖いですか？そんなことないですよ。
それでは技術の話をしよう


🔵🔵🔵
20 years after the Agile Manifesto was written, the title of Agile Coach has been becoming common in the software industry. Most of them tend to use approaches and practices which are focusing on the human side: process, communication, facilitation, and so on.
🔵🔵🔵


⭕️ 技術的視点の必要性を簡潔に説明する
- 技術を教える/教えられるコーチは、少ない印象がある
    - technical practices (like CI/CD, test automation, devops, monitoring, etc.)
    - スキル不足から、技術面を避けるコーチが少なからずいる
- 技術面を避けるコーチは、以下の点で問題になることがある
    - 技術面に改善すべきポイントがある場合に、適切なコーチングができない
    - 技術力のなさから、チームメンバーの信頼を得られない、または対立構造に陥る
        - developers tend not to believe persons who has skills and responsibility of technical aspects.


⭕️ プロセスと技術の両方の視点が必要
- both process and technology are required for Agile Coaching
- both supports each other

- そこで、技術的観点からアジャイルコーチをやるチームを作った
For overcoming these barriers, we constructed Technical Agile Coaches' Unit.

- 実際にこのアプローチで、信頼を得たり、human sideだけではできなかった改善ができている



⭕️⭕️⭕️
When introducing improvement activities to your team, like Test Automation, you will face challenges. Some members and/or teams may oppose your activities. You may find that no one uses tools or solutions you introduced. You may face a shortage of members who have enough skills and knowledge.
⭕️⭕️⭕️
As an **SET (Software Engineer in Test)**, **I faced a lot of challenges and failures**. No clear goals. Dissension among developers, testers, and managers. Negative feedback to my/our solutions... **However, I could overcome them and finally achieved something great!**

**We can change difficulties into something special with proper approaches!**
⭕️⭕️⭕️






⭕️⭕️⭕️
In this talk, I will do the following things:
1)
2)
3)

- 技術アジャイルコーチというもの自体が新鮮
    - SETはこれを志向している
- 技術の必要性
    - 技術的に複雑なプロダクトを開発されているところでは、
        - 技術力のなさから適切なコーチングができない
        - 技術力のなさからチームメンバーの信頼を得られない
    - 技術的アプローチからプロセスを改善できるケースもあるが、それをメインでやっている人は少ない
- "Self-growing" Team


⭕️⭕️⭕️⭕️⭕️
In this talk, I will tell you the following practical ideas and solutions which **relate to testing** I found through my experience as SET **from Scratch**:

1) Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
They are critical to proceed with test-related improvement activities. I will explain useful techniques; **"Product Discovery"** to discover their real concerns, and **"Giving impacts"** to attract them.

2) Experiencing hardships with product development teams together is a key to proceed with activities
We learned that we could provide innovative ideas and solutions by working closely with product development teams. I will explain it through our experience of inventing and improving our failure detection system with **"Karate" framework**, an open-sourced API Testing framework in which we can write test scripts with BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) style.

3) How to nurture members/teams/organizations for your innovative activities
Innovative activities require proper skills, knowledge, persons, and so on. I will tell you **"Learning Session"**, a way to nurture members, teams, and organizations smoothly and quickly. Additionally, I will explain **"Sebas Report"**, our innovative solution example to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages incubated from "Learning Session".

I have been sharing these my improvement ideas over 10 times with our company members. After that, some teams convinced themselves with my ideas and started utilizing them. One team solved its slow test problems on their own. Another team invented a new test infrastructure which made testing easier.

I hope these ideas will help innovate your testing activities!





# Information for Program Team
In order to make my recorded talk more effectively for attendees, I'm planning to shape my talk as follows:
- At first, I'm going to say the conclusion of this session clearly to make attendees more focused on the session.
- I'm going to use lots of graphical images to convey ideas smoothly.

Additionally, I'm going to share my presentation document with attendees before the session.

Here is my rough outlines and timings.

1. Introduction to this session (3 min)
2. Technical issues in Agile Coaches and developers (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain the following points for a later talk:
        - Fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach
        - Technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches for support
3. Examples of solving technical issues with developers (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain ways to enlist cooperation from developers as the Agile Coach based on concrete examples in our team:
        - Combine API Tests and observability mechanism to reduce MTTR
        - Solve complicated test issues step by step
        - Utilize Kubernetes for replicating test environments and data
4. Ways to improve technical skills effectively (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain that working with developers is very effective for Agile Coaches to improve technical skills with concrete examples in our team.
5. Conclusion (3 min)



# Learning Outcomes
- IDENTIFY fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach.
- IDENTIFY technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches for support.
- ARTICULATE ways to enlist cooperation from developers as the Agile Coach.
- ARTICULATE ways to improve technical skills as the Agile Coach **effectively and extremely**.



# Presentation History
I talked at **Agile2014** titled **"Technology-Driven/Development"** in the Experience Report track.
Additionally, I was planned to talk at **Agile2020** titled **"Everything from Scratch: A journey as Software Engineer in Test to improve 'Testing'"** in the Development & Testing Practices track.
