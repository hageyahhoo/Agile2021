- "Self-growing" Team


When introducing improvement activities to your team, like Test Automation, you will face challenges. Some members and/or teams may oppose your activities. You may find that no one uses tools or solutions you introduced. You may face a shortage of members who have enough skills and knowledge.

As an **SET (Software Engineer in Test)**, **I faced a lot of challenges and failures**. No clear goals. Dissension among developers, testers, and managers. Negative feedback to my/our solutions... **However, I could overcome them and finally achieved something great!**

**We can change difficulties into something special with proper approaches!**

In this talk, I will tell you the following practical ideas and solutions which **relate to testing** I found through my experience as SET **from Scratch**:

1) Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
They are critical to proceed with test-related improvement activities. I will explain useful techniques; **"Product Discovery"** to discover their real concerns, and **"Giving impacts"** to attract them.

2) Experiencing hardships with product development teams together is a key to proceed with activities
We learned that we could provide innovative ideas and solutions by working closely with product development teams. I will explain it through our experience of inventing and improving our failure detection system with **"Karate" framework**, an open-sourced API Testing framework in which we can write test scripts with BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) style.

3) How to nurture members/teams/organizations for your innovative activities
Innovative activities require proper skills, knowledge, persons, and so on. I will tell you **"Learning Session"**, a way to nurture members, teams, and organizations smoothly and quickly. Additionally, I will explain **"Sebas Report"**, our innovative solution example to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages incubated from "Learning Session".

I have been sharing these my improvement ideas over 10 times with our company members. After that, some teams convinced themselves with my ideas and started utilizing them. One team solved its slow test problems on their own. Another team invented a new test infrastructure which made testing easier.

I hope these ideas will help innovate your testing activities!





# Information for Program Team
I'm planning to switch my talks and group discussions among attendees iteratively to make attendees consider their own ideas deeply.

I hope to provide pens, sticky notes, and papers for supporting group discussions.

Here is my rough plan.

1. Introduction to this session (5 min)
2. Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
    - (Discussion) What blocks/blocked Test Automation in your organization (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
3. Experiencing hardships with product development teams together is a key to proceed with activities
    - (Discussion) How to persuade developers who stopped writing test scripts (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
4. "Sebas Report": Our innovative solution example to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages
    - (Discussion) What is the difficulty of testing Microservices (5 min)
    - Talk (15 min)
5. Conclusion (5 min)
6. Q&A (5 min)





# Learning Outcomes
- Identify the importance and ways **to obtain consent from decision-makers, developers, testers, and other stakeholders** to proceed with test-related improvement activities.

- Identify the importance of **working with product development teams together** to discover and solve blockers and problems for going forward improvements.

- Identify ideas to nurture members, teams, and organizations for a series of activities mentioned above smoothly and quickly.

- `(Optional)` **Link Test Automation, CI/CD, DevOps, and Monitoring** to tame the complexity of Microservices and reduce their outages.



# Presentation History
I presented at **Agile 2014** titled **"Technology-Driven/Development"** in the Experience Report track.

Since Agile 2014, I have presented several sessions at conferences about Agile Metrics and utilizing technical excellence for "successful" Agile adoption.
Additionally, I have held several workshops about Agile Metrics and Learning Session.
