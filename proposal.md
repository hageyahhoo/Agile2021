# Title
Technical Agile Coach: Practical guides to overcome fears to technologies and solve developers' technical issues as an Agile Coach
- Technical | Experience Report



# Abstract
⭐️ 技術的なアプローチの方法が分からなくて困っていませんか？ ⭐️

技術は怖いですか？そんなことないですよ。
それでは技術の話をしよう


🔵🔵🔵
20 years after the Agile Manifesto was written, the title of Agile Coach has been becoming common in the software industry. Most of them tend to use approaches and practices which are focusing on the human side: process, communication, facilitation, and so on.
🔵🔵🔵


⭕️ 技術を教える/教えられるコーチは、少ない印象がある

- 技術に対する恐怖心 and/or 技術力のなさから、チームメンバーの信頼を得られない、または対立構造に陥る
    - developers tend not to believe persons who has skills and responsibility of technical aspects.
    - technical practices (like CI/CD, test automation, devops, monitoring, etc.)
- 一方でdevelopersも、技術力はあっても、全ての問題を解決できるわけではない。特に技術的にプロセス改善可能な箇所があっても気付きにくい。その点でAgile Coachの力が必要な箇所はある。


上記を克服できることで解決できることは多いが、あまりそれらの方法論が語られることは少ない。

そこで私たちは、技術的観点からアジャイルコーチをやるチームを作った。
For overcoming these barriers, we constructed Technical Agile Coaches' Unit.
- 実際にこのアプローチで、信頼を得たり、human sideだけではできなかった改善ができている

また、高速に技術スキルを学習し伸ばす方法を見つけた！


⭕️⭕️⭕️
When introducing improvement activities to your team, like Test Automation, you will face challenges. Some members and/or teams may oppose your activities. You may find that no one uses tools or solutions you introduced. You may face a shortage of members who have enough skills and knowledge.


⭕️⭕️⭕️
As an **SET (Software Engineer in Test)**, **I faced a lot of challenges and failures**. No clear goals. Dissension among developers, testers, and managers. Negative feedback to my/our solutions... **However, I could overcome them and finally achieved something great!**

**We can change difficulties into something special with proper approaches!**


⭕️⭕️⭕️
In this talk, I will tell you the following practical ideas and solutions which **relate to testing** I found through my experience as SET **from Scratch**:

1) Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
They are critical to proceed with test-related improvement activities. I will explain useful techniques; **"Product Discovery"** to discover their real concerns, and **"Giving impacts"** to attract them.

1) Identifying fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach.
2) Identifying technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches for 
3) ARTICULATE ways to enlist cooperation from developers as the Agile Coach.
4) ARTICULATE ways to improve technical skills as the Agile Coach **effectively and extremely**.

I hope these ideas will help you overcome fears and technical issues with developers.





# Information for Program Team
In order to make my recorded talk more effectively for attendees, I'm planning to shape my talk as follows:
- At first, I'm going to say the conclusion of this session clearly to make attendees more focused on the session.
- I'm going to use lots of graphical images to convey ideas smoothly.

Additionally, I'm going to share my presentation document with attendees before the session.

Here is my rough outlines and timings.

1. Introduction to this session (3 min)
2. Technical issues in Agile Coaches and developers (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain the following points for a later talk:
        - Fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach
        - Technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches for support
3. Examples of solving technical issues with developers (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain ways to enlist cooperation from developers as the Agile Coach based on concrete examples in our team:
        - Combine API Tests and observability mechanism to reduce MTTR
        - Solve complicated test issues step by step
        - Utilize Kubernetes for replicating test environments and data
4. Ways to improve technical skills effectively (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain that working with developers is very effective for Agile Coaches to improve technical skills with concrete examples in our team.
5. Conclusion (3 min)



# Learning Outcomes
- IDENTIFY fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach.
- IDENTIFY technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches for support.
- ARTICULATE ways to enlist cooperation from developers as the Agile Coach.
- ARTICULATE ways to improve technical skills as the Agile Coach **effectively and extremely**.



# Presentation History
I talked at **Agile2014** titled **"Technology-Driven/Development"** in the Experience Report track.
Additionally, I was planned to talk at **Agile2020** titled **"Everything from Scratch: A journey as Software Engineer in Test to improve 'Testing'"** in the Development & Testing Practices track.

Since Agile2014, I have been presenting several sessions at global conferences
about Test Automation, DevOps, Agile Metrics, Product Management, Cloud-native technologies, and so on.
Additionally, I have held several workshops about Agile Metrics and Learning Session.
