# Title
Technical Agile Coach: Practical guides to overcome fears to technologies and solve developers' technical issues as an Agile Coach
- Technical



# Abstract
Have you ever felt fears about technologies when you behave as an Agile Coach?
Don't you have regrets that you could not have contributed to developers effectively due to insufficient technical skills?

**If your answer is YES, why not solving the issue together?**

20 years after the Agile Manifesto was written, the title of Agile Coach has been becoming common in the software industry. Most of them tend to use approaches and practices which are focusing on the human side: process, communication, facilitation, and so on. It may not be due to insufficient technical skills. It may not. However, developers (or product development team members) tend not to believe persons who speak little about technical topics and don't contribute to technical issues. It is a misery to both Agile Coaches and developers.


⭐️ developer側の思い
On the other hand, developers have issues. Not only process ones but also technical ones.
Especially, technical issues are hard for developers to detect. Agile Coaches can detect these issues and contribute to developers.


⭐️ 案外語られること少なくない？
However, 
上記を克服できることで解決できることは多いが、あまりそれらの方法論が語られることは少ない。


⭐️ 解決してみた＆アイデアがある！
そこで私たちは、技術的観点からアジャイルコーチをやるチームを作った。
For overcoming these barriers, we constructed Technical Agile Coaches' Unit.
- 実際にこのアプローチで、信頼を得たり、human sideだけではできなかった改善ができている

また、高速に技術スキルを学習し伸ばす方法を見つけた！

⭕️⭕️⭕️
As an **SET (Software Engineer in Test)**, **I faced a lot of challenges and failures**. No clear goals. Dissension among developers, testers, and managers. Negative feedback to my/our solutions... **However, I could overcome them and finally achieved something great!**

**We can change difficulties into something special with proper approaches!**


⭕️⭕️⭕️
In this talk, I will tell you the following practical ideas and solutions which **relate to testing** I found through my experience as SET **from Scratch**:

1) Importance and how to get support and understanding from decision-makers and colleagues
They are critical to proceed with test-related improvement activities. I will explain useful techniques; **"Product Discovery"** to discover their real concerns, and **"Giving impacts"** to attract them.

1) Clarifying fears
    - fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach.
    - technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches
3) ARTICULATE ways to enlist cooperation from developers as the Agile Coach.
    - Product Discovery for solving technical issues
    - Combining automated tests with developers' monitoring features
4) ARTICULATE ways to improve technical skills as the Agile Coach **effectively and extremely**.
    - Experimenting new tools (e.g. Kubernetes) with developers

I hope these ideas will help you overcome fears and technical issues with developers.





# Information for Program Team
In order to make my recorded talk more effectively for attendees, I'm planning to shape my talk as follows:
- At first, I'm going to say the conclusion of this session clearly to make attendees more focused on the session.
- I'm going to use lots of graphical images to convey ideas smoothly.

Additionally, I'm going to share my presentation document with attendees before the session.

Here is my rough outlines and timings.

1. Introduction to this session (3 min)
2. Technical issues in Agile Coaches and developers (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain the following points for a later talk:
        - Fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach
        - Technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches for support
3. Examples of solving technical issues with developers (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain ways to enlist cooperation from developers as the Agile Coach based on concrete examples in our team:
        - Combine API Tests and observability mechanism to reduce MTTR
        - Solve complicated test issues step by step
        - Utilize Kubernetes for replicating test environments and data
4. Ways to improve technical skills effectively (8 min)
    - I'm going to explain that working with developers is very effective for Agile Coaches to improve technical skills with concrete examples in our team.
5. Conclusion (3 min)



# Learning Outcomes
- IDENTIFY fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach.
- IDENTIFY technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches for support.
- ARTICULATE ways to enlist cooperation from developers as the Agile Coach.
- ARTICULATE ways to improve technical skills as the Agile Coach **effectively and extremely**.



# Presentation History
I talked at **Agile2014** titled **"Technology-Driven/Development"** in the Experience Report track.
Additionally, I was planned to talk at **Agile2020** titled **"Everything from Scratch: A journey as Software Engineer in Test to improve 'Testing'"** in the Development & Testing Practices track.

Since Agile2014, I have been presenting several sessions at global conferences
about Test Automation, DevOps, Agile Metrics, Product Management, Cloud-native technologies, and so on.
Additionally, I have held several workshops about Agile Metrics and Learning Session.
