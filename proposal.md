# Abstract
Have you ever felt fears about technologies when you behave as an Agile Coach?
Don't you have regrets that you could not have contributed to developers effectively due to insufficient technical skills?

**If your answer is YES, why not solving the issue together?**

20 years after the Agile Manifesto was written, the title of Agile Coach has been becoming common in the software industry. Most of them tend to use approaches and practices which are focusing on the human side: process, communication, facilitation, and so on. It may not be due to insufficient technical skills. It may not. However, developers (or product development team members) tend not to believe persons who speak little about technical topics and don't contribute to technical issues. It is a misery to both Agile Coaches and developers.

On the other hand, developers tend to have troubles, not only process ones but also technical ones. Especially, technical issues are hard only for developers to detect and solve. Developers tend to consider mainly or only from their own technical skills. Agile Coaches can contribute to developers at this point.

For overcoming the above issues, we constructed Technical Agile Coaches' Unit in our company. In our team, we could enlist cooperation from developers. Additionally, we could solve a wide variety of developers' technical issues. Moreover, we found ways to improve technical skills very effectively through these activities.

In this talk, I will tell you the following practical ideas to improve technical skills and solve developers' technical issues as an Agile Coach based on experiments in our teams:

1) Importance to identify "fears" which relates to technologies
Identifying the root cause is the primary action for problem-solving. I will explain "fears" which relate to technologies that both Agile Coaches and developers tend to feel based on concrete examples.

2) Examples to enlist cooperation from developers as an Agile Coach
Developers tend to have more technical skills than Agile Coaches. On the other hand, Agile Coaches can contribute to solving technical issues from their traits. These contributions will be the key to enlist cooperation from developers. I will share concrete examples of solving technical issues as an Agile Coach as follows:
- Utilizing "Product Discovery" for solving complicated test issues step by step
- Combining automated API tests with developers' observability mechanism to reduce MTTR
- Utilizing Kubernetes for replicating test environments and data

3) Ways to improve technical skills effectively as an Agile Coach
Agile Coaches tend to be busy. Therefore, improving technical skills effectively and quickly is very critical. Through lots of experiments in our team, we found that working with developers is very effective for Agile Coaches to improve technical skills. I'm going to explain why working with developers is very effective to improve technical skills with concrete examples.

I hope these ideas will help you and related developers enjoy their work more without fears!



# Information for Program Team
In order to make my recorded talk more effectively for attendees, I'm planning to shape my talk as follows:
- At first, I'm going to say the conclusion of this session clearly to make attendees more focused on the session.
- I'm going to use lots of graphical images to convey ideas smoothly.

Additionally, I'm going to share my presentation document with attendees before the session.

Here are my rough outlines and timings.

1. Introduction to this session (3 min)
2. Identify technical issues (or fears) in both Agile Coaches and developers (8 min)
3. Share examples of solving technical issues as an Agile Coach (8 min)
4. Ways to improve technical skills effectively as an Agile Coach (8 min)
5. Conclusion (3 min)



# Learning Outcomes
- IDENTIFY fears to (existing/emerging) technologies as an Agile Coach.
- IDENTIFY technical issues that developers want to ask Agile Coaches for support.
- ARTICULATE ways to enlist cooperation from developers as an Agile Coach.
- ARTICULATE ways to improve technical skills as an Agile Coach **effectively and extremely**.
